    <h1>About VIDA TIA</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I have been trained by the patriarch in a linear format earning degrees from established universities. I worked at prominent institutions like Kennedy Krieger institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Sheppard Pratt for decades.
        </li>
        <li>I have traveled around the world and return regularly to Peru and Spain, my ancestral lands. I honor the wisdom of my ancestors and value their insight into healing.
        </li>
        <li>I have immersed myself in meditation and yoga and have certifications in different modalities. Breath and movement are medicine.
        </li>
        <li>I value creativity and expression and believe that art heals. My hope is to explore this more in the future and provide space for emotional expression through creative expression.
        </li>
        <li>I have studied integrative nutrition and holistic health and continue to learn about plant medicine and the power of the body to heal. Food is medicine.
        </li>

    <h3>VIDA TIA started with the intention to start a health revolution. TIA is a merging of mental health, life coaching and behavior analysis. We focus on going deep, because that is what I 	embody. Sometimes the answer is movement, breathwork, nutrition, learning new coping skills or putting in systems that support our growth. At times we need to rewire old conditioning that is not serving us and clear space for growth.
